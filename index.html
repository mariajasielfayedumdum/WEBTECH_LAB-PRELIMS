<h1> Why talk about Gender Equality? </h1>
		<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gender equality is the view and treatment 
			that everyone should receive without any discrimination based on
			gender. We often talked about it when it comes to power, decision-
			making, employment, gender-based violence, freedom, gender stereotypes,
			harmful traditional practices, portrayal of women in the media, health,
			rights, education and gender mainstreaming. But every time we talk about
			gender equality, we always take the women's side not minding the men's side
			which will balance the understanding of the said topic. The countries in Europe 
			has compiled a Gender Equality Glossary, drawn 
			from international and regional women's human rights instruments. Also, last
			January 21, 2017, during the newly-inaugurated President of the United States,
			Donald Trump, hundreds of thousands of women marched on Washington to fight for
			their rights and to stop sexual harassment. This is an example of women fighting 
			for themselves. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a lot of issues when it comes to equal treatments and the rights
			of women. One issue is the cultural factors like "Patrilocality". It is when a woman gets
			married, she essentially ceases to be a member of her birth family and joins her husband's
			family. Under this system, parents potentially reap more of the returns to investments
			in a son's health and education because he will remain a part of their family, whereas a daughter
			will physically and financially leave the household upon marriage. Based on these cultural factors,
			women don't really have the right to choose the life she wants to live. It's like they were made
			just to take care of their children and stay at home. Also, when it comes to education, parents would 
			prefer to let their son continue studying instead of their daughter because they'll know that one 
			day, she will stay at home and will waste all the knowledge she learned.
